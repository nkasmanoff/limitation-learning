Can we make this quick ?   Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad .   Again . </s>

You 're asking me out .   That 's so cute . What 's your name again ? </s>

Cameron . </s>
The thing is , Cameron -- I 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser .   My sister .   I ca n't date until she does . </s>
Seems like she could get a date easy enough ... </d>
Why ? </s>
Unsolved mystery .   She used to be really popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something . </s>
That 's a shame . </d>
Gosh , if only we could find Kat a boyfriend ... </s>
Let me see what I can do . </d>
C'esc ma tete . This is my head </s>
Right .   See ?   You 're ready for the quiz . </s>
I do n't want to know how to say that though .   I want to know useful things . Like where the good stores are .   How much does champagne cost ?   Stuff like Chat .   I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone . </s>
That 's because it 's such a nice one . </s>
Forget French . </d>

I counted on you to help my cause . You and that thug are obviously failing . Are n't we ever going on our date ? </d>
You have my word .   As a gentleman </s>
You 're sweet . </d>
How do you get your hair to look like that ? </s>
Eber 's Deep Conditioner every two days . And I never , ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment . </d>
