The thing is , <person> -- I 'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser . My sister . I ca n't date until she does . </s>
Seems like she could get a date easy enough ... </d>
Why ? </s>
Unsolved mystery . She used to be really popular when she started high school , then it was just like she got sick of it or something . </s>
That 's a shame . </d>
Gosh , if only we could find <person> a boyfriend ... </s>
Let me see what I can do . </d>
<person> <person> <person> . This is my head </s>
Right . See ? You 're ready for the quiz . </s>

That 's because it 's such a nice one . </s>
Forget <norp> . </d>

I 'm workin ' on it . But she does n't seem to be goin' for him . </d>
She 's not a ... </s>
<norp> ? No . I found a picture of <person> <person> in <cardinal> of her drawers , so I 'm pretty sure she 's not harboring same - sex tendencies . </s>
So that 's the kind of guy she likes ? Pretty ones ? </s>
Who knows ? All I 've ever heard her say is that she 'd dip before dating a guy that smokes . </d>
Hi . </s>
Looks like things worked out <time> , huh ? </d>

Would you mind getting me a drink , <person> ? </d>
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist . I mean . Dr. <person> is great an all , but he 's not exactly relevant party conversation . </s>
Is he oily or dry ? </s>
Combination . I do n't know -- I thought he 'd be different . More of a gentleman ... </d>
<person> , I do n't think the highlights of dating <person> <person> are going to include door - opening and coat - holding . </s>
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we 're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with , you know ? </s>
All I know is -- I 'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like <person> . </d>
I have to be home in <time> <time> . </s>

You 're concentrating awfully hard considering it 's gym class . </d>
Listen , I want to talk to you about the prom . </s>
You know the deal . I can ' t go if <person> does n't go -- </d>
Where 've you been ? </s>
Nowhere ... Hi , Daddy . </d>
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you do n't get out of my way . </s>
Can you at least start wearing a bra ? </d>
Oh my God , does this mean you 're becoming normal ? </s>
It means that <person> is playing at <org> <org> and we 're going . </s>
Oh , I thought you might have a date I do n't know why I 'm bothering to ask , but are you going to Bogey <person> 's party <time> <time> ? </s>
What do you think ? </s>
I think you 're a freak . I think you do this to torture me . And I think you suck . </d>
You 're ruining my life ' Because you wo n't be normal , I ca n't be normal . </s>
What 's normal ? </s>
Bogey <person> 's party is normal , but you 're too busy listening to <work_of_art> <work_of_art> <work_of_art> <work_of_art> to know that . </d>
Ca n't you forget for <time> <time> <time> that you 're completely wretched ? </s>
At least I 'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge - pig . </d>
Like I 'm supposed to know what that even means . </s>
It 's <person> . Maybe you 've heard of him ? </s>
Yeah , he 's your freak friend <person> 's boyfriend . I guess since I 'm not allowed to go out , I should obsess over a dead guy , too . </d>
You are so completely unbalanced . </s>
Can we go now ? </d>
<person> , I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you -- </s>
I really do n't think I need any social advice from you right now . </d>
I do n't get you . You act like you 're too good for any of this , and then you go totally apeshit when you get here . </s>
You 're welcome . </d>
Listen , I know you hate having to sit home because I 'm not <org> <org> <org> . </s>
Like you care . </s>
I do care . But I 'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons , not someone else ' s . </s>
I wish I had that luxury . I 'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I ca n't go , because you won ' t. </d>
<person> never told you we went out , did he ? </s>
What ? </s>
In <date> . For <date> <date> </s>
Why ? </s>
He was , like , a total babe </s>
But you hate <person> </s>
Now I do . Back then , was a different story . </s>
As in ... </d>
He said everyone was doing it . So I did it . </s>
You did what ? </s>
Just once . Afterwards , I told him I did n't want to anymore . I was n't ready . He got pissed . Then he broke up with me . </d>
But </s>
After that , I swore I 'd never do anything just because " everyone else " was doing it . And I have n't since . Except for <product> 's party , and my stunning gastro - intestinal display -- </s>
Why did n't you tell me ? </s>
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him . </s>
No . you did n't ! If you really thought I could make my own decisions , you would 've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage . </d>
That 's not </s>
I 'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes . </s>
I guess I thought I was protecting you . </s>
God , you 're just like him ! Just keep me locked away in the dark , so I ca n't experience anything for myself </s>
Not all experiences are good , <person> . You ca n't always trust the people you want to . </s>
I guess I 'll never know , will I ? </d>
You looked beautiful <time> <time> , you know . </s>
So did you </d>
Let go ! </s>
You set me up . </s>
I just wanted -- </s>
What ? To completely damage me ? To send me to therapy forever ? What ? </s>
No ! I just wanted </d>
Is that woman a complete fruit - loop or is it just me ? </s>
It 's just you . </d>

Perm ? </d>
Now do n't get upset . Daddy , but there 's this boy ... and I think he might ask ... </s>
No ! You 're not dating until your sister starts dating . End of discussion . </s>
What if she never starts dating ? </s>
Then neither will you . And I 'll get to sleep at <time> . </s>
But it 's not fair -- she 's a mutant , Daddy ! </d>
But she does n't want to date . </s>
Exactly my point </d>
Daddy , I -- </s>
And where 're you going ? </s>
If you must know , we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends . </s>
Otherwise known as an orgy ? </s>
It 's just a party . Daddy , but I knew you 'd forbid me to go since " <work_of_art> <work_of_art> " over there is n't going -- </d>
Daddy , people expect me to be there ! </s>
If <person> 's not going , you 're not going . </d>
Oh , God . It 's starting . </s>
It 's just a party . Daddy . </d>
Wear the belly before you go . </s>
Daddy , no ! </s>
Just for a minute </d>
Promise me you wo n't talk to any boys unless your sister is present . </s>
Why ? </s>
Because she 'll scare them away . </d>

The prom ? <person> has a date ? </s>
No , but </s>
It 's that hot rod <person> , right ? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for ? </s>
He 's not a " hot rod " . Whatever that is . </s>
You 're not going unless your sister goes . End of story . </s>
Fine . I see that I 'm a prisoner in my own house . I 'm not a daughter . I 'm a possession ! </d>
I 'm missing something . </s>
I have a date , Daddy . And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know . </d>
Always a pleasure , <person> . </s>
Did n't have you pegged for a <person> fan . Are n't they a little too pre - teen belly - button ring for you ? </s>
Fan of a fan . You see a couple of minors come in ? </s>

That girl -- I -- </s>
You burn , you pine , you perish ? </s>
Who is she ? </s>
<person> <person> . Sophomore . Do n't even think about it </s>
Why not ? </s>
I could start with your haircut , but it does n't matter . She 's not allowed to date until her older sister does . And that 's an impossibility . </d>
Why do girls like that always like guys like that ? </s>
Because they 're bred to . Their mothers liked guys like that , and their grandmothers before them . Their gene pool is rarely diluted . </s>
He always have that shit - eating grin ? </s>
<person> <person> ? Perma - shit - grin . I wish I could say he 's a moron , but he 's number <cardinal> in the class . And a model . Mostly regional stuff , but he 's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out . </d>
You know <norp> ? </s>
Sure do ... my Mom 's from <gpe> </s>
Guess who just signed up for a tutor ? </s>
You mean I 'd get a chance to talk to her ? </s>
You could consecrate with her , my friend . </d>
Yeah , just a minor encounter with the shrew . </s>
That 's her ? <person> 's sister ? </s>
The mewling , <person> wretch herself . </d>
I teach her <norp> , get to know her , dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me . </s>
Unlikely , but even so , she still ca n't go out with you . So what 's the point ? </d>
What about him ? </s>
You wanna go out with him ? </d>
What makes you think he 'll do it ? </s>
He seems like he thrives on danger </s>
No kidding . He 's a criminal . I heard he lit a state trooper on fire . He just got out of <loc> ... </s>
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology ? </s>
I 'm serious , man , he 's whacked . He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers . </s>
Forget his reputation . Do you think we 've got a plan or not ? </s>
Did she actually say she 'd go out with you ? </s>
That 's what I just said </d>
You know , if you do go out with <person> , you 'd be set . You 'd outrank everyone . Strictly A - list . With me by your side . </s>
I thought you hated those people . </s>
Hey -- I 've got ta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street . </d>
You got him involved ? </s>
Like we had a choice ? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he 's orchestrating the battle , you 're in a position of power . We let him pretend he 's calling the shots , and while he 's busy setting up the plan , you have time to woo <person> . </d>
This is it . A golden opportunity . <person> can ask <person> to the party . </s>
In that case , we 'll need to make it a school - wide blow out . </s>
Will Bogey get bent ? </s>
Are you kidding ? He 'll piss himself with joy . He 's the ultimate kiss ass . </d>
Number <cardinal> . She hates smokers </s>

You told me that part already . </s>
Hell , I 've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - </d>
Extremely unfortunate maneuver . </s>
The hell is that ? What kind of ' guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you 're talking to her ? </s>
<person> <person> . But hey , you 're making progress . </s>
No , I ' m not . </d>
You humiliated the woman ! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score . </s>
Best case scenario , you 're back on the payroll for awhile . </d>
And he means that strictly in a non- prison - movie type of way . </s>
Yeah -- we 'll see . </d>
What 've you got for me ? </s>
I 've retrieved certain pieces of information on <person> <person> <person> I think you 'll find helpful . </d>

She hates you with the fire of a <cardinal> suns . That 's a direct quote </s>
She just needs time to cool off I 'll give it a day . </d>
You makin ' any headway ? </s>
She kissed me . </s>

What 's the worst ? </s>
You get the girl . </d>

But you 'd go out with her if you had the cake ? </d>
You got it , <gpe> . I pick up the tab , you do the honors . </s>
You 're gon na pay me to take out some girl ? </s>
I ca n't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend . And that 's the catch . She does n't want a boyfriend . </s>
How much ? </d>
I ca n't take a girl like that out on <money> <money> . </s>

Take it or leave it . This is n't a negotiation . </s>

Well , actually , I thought I 'd run an idea by you . You know , just to see if you 're interested . </s>
We 're not . </d>
But she ca n't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her . right ? </s>
Does this conversation have a purpose ? </s>
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who 'll go out with her . Someone who 's up for the job . </d>

Uh , yeah . We 're old friend * </s>
You and <gpe> ? </s>

An attempted slit . </d>
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with <person> <person> is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . You 're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy . </s>
But imagine the things he 'd say during sex . </d>
The people at this school are so incredibly foul . </s>
You could always go with me . I 'm sure <person> has some friends . </d>

I am , Your Eminence </s>
Then you can not ignore that according to their calculations , the circumference of the <loc> is approximately ... <cardinal> leagues or more . Which makes the ocean ... uncrossable . </d>

If God intended our proximity to <loc> , do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world ? </s>
Did He not choose a carpenter 's son to reveal Himself to the world ? </d>
Do n't you realize your words could be considered heretical ? </s>
Blind faith is what I consider heresy ! </d>
<loc> can be found to the west -- and I will prove it . </s>
IF - GOD - WILLS - IT ! </d>
The <org> has some reason to be interested in this man 's proposition , Your Eminence ... </s>
The <org> is ours ! </s>
Naturally . But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for <gpe> for a ... dispute over a point of geography . </d>
He is a mercenary ! Did he not already try to convince <person> <person> <person> <person> of his absurd notions ? </s>
Indeed . The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them , when it benefits them . My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of <gpe> . </d>
It wo n't be easy to get rid of your prophet now , <person> <person> . </s>
On the contrary , Your Eminence . It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross . </d>

Father ... </s>
There must be a passage to that other ocean . </d>
What are you listening to ? </s>
I am not listening , Father . But I ca n't help hearing . </d>

I remind you , <person> <person> , that you are in no position to bargain with me . </s>
I 'm not bargaining ! </s>
Then you are too ambitious . </d>
And were you never ambitious , Excellency ? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles , a fault for the rest of us ? </s>
If you wo n't accept our proposal , we 'll simply find someone who will . </d>
They do n't see sin in their nakedness . They live according to nature , in <date> <date> <date> <date> . The islands are covered with trees , filled with blossoms and fruits . And ... </s>
Forgive me , <person> <person> . But what about gold ? </d>
You defend yourself admirably ... </s>

But we do have a lack of notaries . You should contact my administration . </s>
<person> <person> is already a judge , my Dear <person> <person> . </s>
Good ! We are also in need of judges . Except there are no thieves ! </d>
You seem to have a special talent for making friends . </s>
What ... ? Do I have so many already ? </s>
To rise so high , in so short a time , is a dangerous occupation . A little hypocrisy goes a long way . </d>
All I have to do is call the guards . </s>
Call them . </d>
I am not afraid of you . You are nothing but a dreamer . </s>
Look out of that window . </d>
What do you see ? </s>

Father , I am doing what I think is the best for him . And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself . </d>
God ... That 's in <date> <date> ! </s>
That 's what it says . </s>
How did you manage it ? </s>
With some difficulty . I had to promise them you were not a total fool . </d>
Why do you wish to sail west ? </s>
To open a new route to <loc> . At the moment there are <cardinal> <cardinal> ways of reaching it ... </d>
How can you be so certain ? The <loc> is said to be infinite . </s>
Ignorance ! I believe the <norp> are <cardinal> <cardinal> <cardinal> <cardinal> leagues west of <loc> <loc> <loc> . </s>
How can you be so certain ? </s>
The calculations of <gpe> Marin de Tyr , <person> ... </s>

All of them ! Just lies ! </s>
Colon ! Do n't ! </d>
In <person> <person> <person> <person> , et Spiritus <person> . </s>
Forgive me , Father . For I have sinned . </d>
I am listening , my son . </s>
Father , I have betrayed my family . I betrayed my men . And I betrayed you . </s>
What are you saying ? </s>
I lied . The journey will be longer than I said . </s>
How long ? </s>
I am not sure ... It could be twice the distance . </d>
May God forgive you ... ! You must tell them ! You must tell your men ! </s>

The ocean is uncrossable ? </s>
What did they say about <gpe> before <date> ? </s>
That she was impregnable . </d>
I can not ignore the verdict of my council . </s>

Thank you . </s>
There is one thing I 'd like to understand ... Why do you want to go back , after all this ? </s>
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things . I must see them with my own eyes . I can not be other than I am . </d>
And you say this is an <norp> vice ? By God ! I do n't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin . </s>
The <norp> have no such word , <person> <person> . </d>

You want a war ? Fine . We are <cardinal> <cardinal> . They outnumber us by <cardinal> ! Who will you kill ? Which tribe ? </s>
We do n't need to know . </s>
We came here to stay ! To build ! Not to start a crusade . In this forest , there is enough danger to sweep us away in <date> ! So we will be brave and swallow our grief . And in the name of those who died , we will accomplish what we came for . </d>
We ca n't raise the wheel without it . </s>
My horse does n't work . </d>
<person> <person> -- we all have to work . </s>
You did not hear me , <person> <person> . Not my horse . </d>
In <cardinal> act of brutality , you have created chaos . Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us ! All that because of your criminal savagery ! </s>
Savagery is what monkeys understand . </s>
You 'll be held in detention , deprived of your privileges and possessions . Until you are returned to <gpe> where you will be judged . Have you anything to say ? </s>
You will regret this . </d>
Due west , Captain <person> . And may God be with us ... </s>

You were right , <person> <person> ... His demands could never be granted . </s>
Never , Your Majesty . Although ... </d>

Yes . It would be a pity , would n't it ? Call him back ! </d>
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying . But with no gold ! The new world proves expensive , Your Majesty . </s>
We were n't expecting immediate profits , were we ? We must have faith . We must give time for time . </d>

Then , what do you suggest , <person> <person> ? </s>
He must be replaced . </s>
And who would you think of , for such a task ? </d>
I know , I should not tolerate his impertinence . </s>
Then why ? </s>
Because he is not afraid of me . </d>
Are you my attorney ? I 'm <person> . I 'm insane . </s>
I 'm not your lawyer until I see the money . </s>

I ca n't take you to my place . </s>
Somewhere else ? </d>
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires . </s>
So ... the station is empty ? </s>
Yeah . This way . </d>
You considered becoming a prostitute ? </s>
Yes , I considered it . </s>
Did you ever turn tricks before ? </s>
No . </s>
What about back home ? </s>
No . </d>
I came here . I had no money . I knew no one . I could n't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work . They approached me - I could 've made a lot of money . I considered it , but ... it 's not who I am . They pay me below the table at <person> 's . </s>
So you were never a prostitute ? </s>
What are you asking me ? </s>
I 'm just trying to find out who you are . </d>
I 'm not a whore . I 'm not a whore . </s>

You do n't know . I 'm sorry . I was desperate . That 's not me . I shot a cop . Can you imagine what they 'll do to me when I got to prison ? </s>
They 're not gon na send you right back . </s>
I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to ... I'm glad . Actually I 'm glad it 's over . All this time . Hiding . Never being able to look anyone in the eyes . Always afraid that someone would find out who I was . Never trusting anyone ... </d>

I 'm sorry . </d>

No , no , do n't talk to Immigration ! </d>
A cop ? </s>
I 'm from a small town in <gpe> . Like the <loc> here . The Police is right , a civilian is wrong . So I fled . </s>
Look , we can help you but right now we have to deal with what 's happening here . Tell us the truth ... is that the truth ? </s>
You 're a cop - you 'll never believe me . </d>
Oh . </s>
It was my decision , not his . </s>
Well , I 'm the Deputy Chief <person> <person> and every now and then I 'd like to be included in decisions . </s>
Look , after <person> briefs me , you can do the press conference . How about that ? The case is all yours . </s>
Oh yeah ... ? Alright . </s>
I 'm ready to be briefed . Excuse us . </s>
Yeah , sure . Beep me when you 're ready for the press conference . </d>
Who did cause and origin ? </s>
Who do you think , Chief ? ! </s>
Then why did n't you talk to the reporter ? </s>
'Cause we got more important things to do , like finding out who did it . </d>
Hey , Chief , what are you doing here ? </s>
I came to see how the investigation was going . I called and you 're not here . I wait up at the station and you do n't even show up ! ! ! I beep you - you do n't return my call . Where the hell have you been ? ! </d>
Ladder <cardinal> was on the Rock for training . We stopped there ... so she could get cleaned up . </s>
What do you mean , ' cleaned up ? ' </s>
I let her take a shower . </s>
A shower ! ? Did you take one , too ? </s>
No ! Nothing happened . </s>
Oh really . That 's nice . You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot ? Are you out of your fucking mind ? ? Are you having that much trouble gettin ' dates ? ! </d>
Chief - mind if I take her ? </s>
Okay . But not water sports . </d>
The public does n't have any idea what we do and now you 're going to define our image ! This is going to be our <person> <person> ! </s>
What was I supposed to do ? The guy tried to mug me . I was gon na send a cop back - I just forgot . </s>
Forgot ? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree ? ! </s>
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian . </s>
Well this is gon na end your career and probably mine . </s>
End my career ? </s>
How are you going to fight this ? Maybe if <person> had n't gotten away and you 'd been on the front page , as a hero , this thing would be easier to fight . You 'd have the good to weight against the bad ! It 's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there 's nothing I can do ! <person> your shield . </s>
But Chief ? Over this ? ? </s>
There 's nothing to talk about . Get a good lawyer . You 're suspended until your trial . </d>
Do n't you guys understand ? It 's all about image . The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime . </s>
Yeah , right . </s>
What was that , <person> ? </s>
I said , yeah , you 're right , Chief . As soon as we get somethin' we 'll let you alert the media . </s>
You do that , wiseguy . Now let 's solve this thing before <person> <person> does . </d>
Did the <person> videotape her deposition ? </s>
Yeah . He finished awhile ago . </s>
Alright . Swing by her apartment . Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to <fac> <fac> . You got that ? </s>
Yeah . </d>
Coffee for me , I got ta slow down . </s>
Vodka tonic . </s>
Maybe you could just put in a shot of <person> ? </d>
It was freaky , I 'll tell you . Stupid kid . </s>
What 's the kid gon na say - sorry ? Meanwhile I 'm not here anymore . Like <date> <date> - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan . <time> <time> <time> this guy was walkin ' his dog or buyin ' a <cardinal> of milk . Who knows ? But some kid 's robbed him for $ <money> or some shit and shot him and now you ca n't tell if he 's a piece of beef or a human being and I 'm thinkin ' that 's me . Sooner or later . That 's me . </d>
I 'm gon na propose . </s>
When ? </s>
<date> . At lunch . </s>
You ready ? </d>
What 's he looking for ? </s>
A timer . </d>
Where is she ? </s>
Takin ' a bath . </s>
Any I.D. ? </s>
Still unknown but we 're running prints . Kid over there caught the case . </d>
Sorry ... <org> only . </s>
It 's okay . </d>
<cardinal> <cardinal> guys checked in ? </s>
Yeah . </s>
C'mere . You wanna go to homicide school ? Here - make yourself useful . </d>
The other side of the street . The guy with the videocamera . Do n't look - put her in the car . Stay this side . </s>
Stay with her . </d>
Are you hit ? </s>
No . I 'm okay . </d>
He got my gun ! <person> was filming the whole time ! </s>
I know . Relax . Take it easy . Do n't worry , we 'll get those <norp> . </d>
Who 's there ? </s>
Police . We 'd like to ask you a few questions . </s>
I have nothin' to say . If you wanna contact my attorney ... </s>
Homicide , <person> <person> . It 's Detective <person> <person> . Open up . </d>
What 's wrong ? </s>
We do n't have her <gpe> yet , but one of your girls was killed <time> <time> at <fac> <fac> <fac> <fac> . </s>
Oh my G - d . Honey ! <person> 's dead ? </d>
Yeah . He wanted a girl from <gpe> , but I sent him <person> 'cause once they get there , you know , it does n't really matter - Honey was killed ... ? Poor girl ... </s>
Do you have any <norp> girls working for you ? </s>
No . </s>
Did you tell him you did ? </d>
Boy , she 's so popular all the sudden . </s>
What are you saying ? </s>
<person> . Another guy came in asking me about her , too . </d>
He said he was her cousin . I told him where she works . They were just here . </s>
Describe him . </s>
Tall , short - haired , scary eyes . <ordinal> guy with him was ... shorter , with a wrestler 's build . And he would n't turn his videocamera off me . </s>
He had a videocamera ? Where is she ? Quickly ! </s>
She washes hair up at <person> 's - a salon on <date> and <gpe> . </d>
Hey , that 's great you guys got it all wrapped up , but you do n't mind if we go through the routine ? It gives us somethin' to do . </s>
No , we do n't mind . You mind <person> ? </d>
You know what that is , right ? </s>
No , what is it ? </s>
Why do n't you explain it , <person> . Hey <person> ! You mind punching a hole in the floor ? </d>
It 's your crime scene now . You can do what you want . </s>
Watch the news ? </s>
<org> , I musta missed it . </s>
Well , just so you know . I gave you guys the credit . </s>
Well , just so you know , I do n't care about that stuff . </s>
<org> , why should you ? </s>
I do n't even watch TV . </s>
Good . Good . Commendable . </d>
Did you get a report from the <org> ? </s>
Sure . But I would like to ask you something . You got a problem with me ? </s>
If you found me steppin ' on your crime scene - it might piss you off , too . What about the report ? </s>
You were right , they were both dead before the fire . The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine . That 's usually an indicator of something personal . </d>
The <org> said he 'd seen her before but she did n't live here . </s>
Pretty . </s>
Hmmmm . </s>
Maybe you do n't care about that either . Prettiest suspect I 've had in awhile . </s>
Who says she 's a suspect ? </d>
What would you call her ? </s>
Look , I 'm not even sure she has anything to do with this . I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead . Maybe she saw something . Maybe she was visiting somebody here . Who knows ? </d>
Maybe it 's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message . Burial rites are taken very seriously in <loc> <loc> . It could be to humiliate them . Just burning them up , no proper funeral , it 's like condemning them to hell . </s>
<org> <org> . Like what ? <gpe> ? <gpe> ? </s>
Or <gpe> . The <norp> have been fighting the <norp> and the <norp> for <date> <date> <date> . These are very intense people and they take things personally . </d>
I 'll come with you . </s>
There was n't a fire . There 'll be nothing for you to do . </s>
I can watch you , <person> . Maybe I 'll learn something . </s>
This is n't homicide school . </s>
My parents are from <gpe> . I can help with the <norp> <norp> angle . </s>
You 're <norp> ? </s>
My folks are . </s>
Stay here . </d>
You goin' to the escort service ? </s>
You got any better ideas ? </s>
Mind if I ride along with you ? </s>
This has nothing to do with your fire . </s>
But what if it does ? You might need my help . </d>
I 'll let you know what happens . </s>
This is ridiculous . I 'm not gon na be in your way - we can talk the case over . </s>
Tell you what - I 'll flip you a coin . If you win you can come with me . If you do n't win , you do n't come . </s>
I 'll call it ... tails . </d>
<cardinal> heads . </s>
<cardinal> <cardinal> <cardinal> . </d>
Leon - meet us at <date> and <gpe> . Hair salon . <person> 's . </s>
I 'm on my way with <person> . <person> 's . <date> and <person> . The suspects might be there already . </d>
You thirsty ? </s>
I 'm on duty . </s>
So am <person> <person> Alright , I 'll go inside and you cover the back . </s>
Of course . </s>
Hey ! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid . I dreamed of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling ' Freeze ! ' at the bad guy ! What 'd you dream about ? </s>
I wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid . </s>
Then I guess we 're doin' this the right way , are n't we ? If we pull up to a burning building I 'll gladly let you go <ordinal> . </d>
What are you hiding ? Why are you afraid </s>
She just saw <cardinal> of her friends killed ! They probably threatened her . </s>
Is that all there is ? </d>
Why not ? </s>
Something back home ? </d>
She 's fucked . Even if that story is true . </s>
Raw deal . </d>
Look - let me talk to her . Any leads I get , they 're all yours . Just let me have a <ordinal> crack at her . </s>
You wanna talk to her alone ? </s>
Yeah . </s>
What would your girlfriend think of that ? </s>
I do n't have a girlfriend . </s>
My point exactly . </s>
I 'm serious here . </s>
So am I. </s>
C'm on . You intimidate her 'cause you 're a celebrity . She sees me differently . </s>
You 're her Savior ? Is she the kid you 're gon na save from the burning building ? </s>
You know what I 'm saying here . </d>
Okay , tell you what , I 'll give you a head start . You take her to the station house . Do n't let her out of your sight . She 's the only warm body we got left . </s>
Hey . I 'm a professional . </s>
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs . </d>
Look , <person> , I 'm tellin ' you - I did n't touch her . </s>
Well , you shoulda because nobody 's gon na believe you didn't ... including me . </s>
I took her there for a shower and that 's it . </s>
Just a shower ? </d>
Yeah , just her in the shower . Nothing happened . Look , I 'm sure you probably think I 'm a fool and I fucked up , but ... </s>
No , I do n't think you were a fool , I just think you were stupid about it . I mean , to say the least , you outta know better . You do n't know her well enough . She 's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her , it 's fuckin ' over . You can deny it all you want , but it will not make <cardinal> fucking bit of difference . You 're dead . </s>
I told you , you know , I thought I was doing the right thing , you know , I think she 's innocent . </s>
Well , it 's not up to you to decide whether she 's innocent or not . Do n't you understand , that 's why you 're a professional . </s>
But , I mean , did n't you ever go out on a limb for somebody ? I mean , you shoulda heard her there . <org> ' her whole story ... I believed her . </s>
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an <org> lawyer . Here , here 's a number of an <org> lawyer . That 's how you help her . But you ca n't get involved in her like that . You 're gon na jeopardize your career , your life and you 're gon na jeopardize my case . And lemme give you another piece of advice . Maybe you do n't watch TV but I 'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin ' world watches television . And when you get out there , they know your face . And the little fame , the little fuckin ' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job . And I get more done because of it . </d>
Why 'd you help me back there with the Chief ? Why 'd you stand up for me like that ? </s>
You know , I do n't know . I like you . You remind me of a puppy I used to have . He pissed on the rug all the time , but I still kept him . </d>
So ... who 's <person> ? </s>
What do you want ? </s>
Your opinion . You see , they going to make a movie about me , too , <person> . And write books . </s>
What 's your accomplishment . </s>
I kill someone famous . </s>
Then do it , asshole . </s>
Good - be tough to the end . Actor who plays you will want to die like hero . </d>
So tabloids do n't have to do re enactments . They going to have real movie this time . </s>
If you kill me and film it you 're putting a noose around your neck . </d>
You really think you 'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit ? How fuckin ' stupid are you ? </s>
Smarter than <norp> . You 're fed cry baby talk shows all day long . Not only will <norp> believe me , they 'll cry for me . So ... Detective <person> <person> , would you like to say goodbye to your <person> ? Maybe you can propose to her now ? </d>
Detective , does it look like a murder ? </s>
We do n't know that yet . It 's much too early . There 's a lot to be done . </s>
How many victims are up there ? </s>
There are <cardinal> bodies found at this point . </s>
Can we go up to the crime scene ? </s>
You know you ca n't do that . C'm on . </s>
Is it drug related ? </s>
We do n't know . When I have more I 'll let you know . </d>
Detective - can you tell us what happened here ? </s>
I ca n't talk right now . We have some things to take care of . </d>
I understand , but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you . Is this somehow related to the fire department ? </s>
I really ca n't give out any information right now at this point . </s>
Okay . But I do understand that your partner , <person> <person> <person> been injured . Is that correct ? </s>
He was hurt , but not seriously . He 'll be fine . </s>
Do you have the suspect in custody ? </s>
Um ... now is not a good time , okay . Detective <person> 's hurt . He 's fine . I 've got a Fire Marshall shot , <person> <person> is hurt but not seriously . </s>
Alright , cut , cut , cut . </d>
<person> , are you okay ? </s>
Yeah . Now 's not a good time . </s>
Alright . </s>
Alright ? </s>
Alright . </s>
Alright . </s>
Okay . </d>
Hey , honey . </s>
Hey . </d>
What is your problem ? Why 'd you snap at me ? I just wanted a statement . </s>
I can't ... I ca n't answer you just because you want me to answer you ! </s>
You did n't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues . You could give me something . </s>
Oh , I 'm sorry . Did I embarrass you , sweetheart ? Oh ... </s>
Stop it . </s>
Maybe I should just , ya know ... turn to the cameras and say , do you mind if we just work something out ? </s>
Alright , alright , <person> . Do n't patronize me . </s>
I 'm not . </s>
Yes you are . I 'm not just some reporter . I do n't just stick a microphone in your face . You could give me something . </s>
Yeah , well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence . That was ... </s>
That was good . You were holding the evidence . </s>
You were merciless . You did n't give a shit if you got me or not . </s>
Well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? Huh ? </s>
You 're ruthless . </s>
You 're not so bad yourself . </d>
Look at this . You have blood on your shirt . Whose is it ? </s>
Could be <person> 's . </s>
<person> . And <date> <date> you came over with blood on your shoes . What am I going to do with you ? </d>
Do n't worry about the damn phone . I wo n't answer it . </s>
Answer the phone . </s>
No . Tell me what you want to say . </s>
Answer it . </s>
Okay . Okay . Hold that thought just for a <ordinal> . They only call me when it 's an emergency . Just hold that thought . Can you call back ? </d>
Oh my G - d , they want me to anchor . They want me to anchor <time> ! </s>
That 's good . </s>
Yeah . </s>
Well , that 's great . </s>
Okay . That is great . But I ca n't go now , we 're in the middle of something here . </s>
No . Go ahead . You 're gon na be great . </s>
No . No , listen to me here . I want to know what you 're talking about . You know , the shoe thing and the marriages and ... </s>
I 'll tell you <time> . Let 's do it <time> . As soon as you get back we 'll talk . We 'll talk . </s>
Promise ? </s>
I promise . We 'll talk . You 'll be great . You 'll be fine . Go ahead , just imagine that , uh ... Just look into the lens and imagine you 're talking to me . </s>
Yeah . I 'll do that . As long as you 're not patronizing me . </s>
Patronizing you ... <person> , I love you . </s>
I love you . </d>
Okay , til <time> . </s>
<time> . </s>
You promise ? </s>
Yeah . I promise . </s>
Okay . And you know what , I 'll swing by my place , grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours ... How 's that ... Would that be a good thing . </s>
Yeah , yeah . Good thing . </s>

Thank you . </s>

So we 're waitin ' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin ' by - ready to go . I say , lemme get a cigar outta the car . I go to get the cigar and BOOM ! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go . Right where I was standin ' . That coulda been it . I coulda had my head blown off and for what ? Some stupid kid got panicky , takes the safety off and it 's over . If I had n't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would 've had my head blown off . </s>

No . We are insane . Who else but crazy men would film their murders ? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught , we are sent to mental hospital . But what good is money there ?

Because of your <org> <org> law , we ca n't be tried for same crime twice . We come out free , rich and famous ! </s>

Of course he 's moody . He thinks he 's in love . </s>
In love ? With who ? </d>

And you , you 'll pay for what you did ! </s>
This footage will work in your favor . When the jury sees this - no matter what <org> tries , they 'll convict him . </d>
You outta be ashamed . Ashamed of yourself . </s>
If I did n't put it on somebody else would ! I was his friend ! </s>
Do n't give me that fucking shit . </d>

That <time> . He was talking to me and <person> about marriage . </s>
Oh my G - d . We were having lunch here . He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him . I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him ! ! </d>
Yes ... he 's my friend . </s>
Okay . You 're a <norp> national and you 're a <norp> national . How do you know one another ? </d>

Then answer my questions . Where were you planning to stay during <date> <date> <date> that you 're here ? </s>

Look , I do n't have time for you , get out of my way ! ! </s>

Okay , you 're under arrest ! Now you happy ? </s>

What 's that on your forehead , <person> ? That 's a nice attention getter . </s>

How did you start the fire this time ? </s>

Oh yeah , why ? </s>
'Cause <person> woulda locked him up by now ! </d>
<org> , not at all . Detective <person> <person> <person> <person> . My Uncle <person> worked with you at <cardinal> - 1 back when you were a rookie . </s>
Could you put out the cigar ? Part of the job is picking up scents . </d>
Mouth 's clean , too . </s>
Clean ? </s>
Do n't blow your nose ! </d>
The <person> permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out . Let it run . </s>
But you knew that , right ? </d>
You see <person> 's face when I gave him the timer ? Wish I had a picture of it . </s>
He knew all along . </s>
What ? ? </s>
That 's why he was so quiet . He was testing us . </d>
What ? </s>
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us . She looked scared . Oh shit ! Oh no ! </d>
Now that you know him , maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him . </s>
Yeah ? </s>
Maybe you can be his stand - in . </d>
-- From <gpe> ? And how long have they been livin ' in your building ? Alright , I 'll be in touch when we know somethin' . <person> and <person> <person> . They were quiet and kept to themselves . Landlord do n't know who your girl is . </s>

It hurts . Aw , <person> ! </s>
Lay down . Stay down , <person> . </d>
How was it ? </s>
Not good . </d>
Get outta here ! </s>
What the hell happened ? </s>
They were inside . They booby trapped her apartment ! </d>

<person> ? That 's not <norp> or <language> . Who said he sounded <norp> ? </s>
The clerk ? </d>
What are you gon na do ? </s>
Do n't you get it ? He knew he was gon na get caught ! That 's why he videotaped <person> 's murder - he thinks he 's gon na get off . </s>
Do n't stoop to his level ! </d>
Take the car . Get outta here , <person> . </s>
Look , you ca n't shoot him in cold blood . </s>
GET OUTTA HERE NOW ! ! GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY ! ! ! DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU , TOO ! ! ! </d>
This had nothing to do with shoes that did n't fit or my relationship with my father who , as you know , made a fortune selling penny loafers in <date> <date> . These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor . </s>
Your doctor ? </s>
Yes . My psychiatrist did n't insist that I stay on my medication . </s>
... so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people ? </s>
It was my finger that pulled the trigger , but I 'm not morally responsible . My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of . How could I know . I 'm not a doctor . </s>
You seem very savvy for a man who 's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial . </s>
Look , I 'm a victim here , too . I was <date> <date> away from getting my masters in Art , now I 'll never graduate . My life has been permanently disrupted . </s>
Permanently disrupted ? Are n't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money ? Has n't this ' incident ' as you call it , jump started your career as an artist ? </s>
Look , I 'm in here . You call this a career move ? </s>
And is n't there a movie in the works about you ? </s>
We 're in negotiations , that 's correct . </s>
But does n't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes ? </s>
That does n't apply to me because I 'm not a criminal . I 'm not a criminal ! I was n't convicted . </d>
SPACE STATTION <cardinal> - LOUNGE </s>
Well , how nice to see you again , <person> . You 're looking wonderful . </d>
CONTINUED </s>
I 'm afraid I 've only got <time> <time> <time> , but I 'd love to . </d>
CONTINUED </s>
She 's wonderful . </d>
CONTINUED </s>
Well , I suppose they 've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment . </d>
CONTINUED </s>
How did they manage to do that without any communication ? </d>
CONTINUED </s>
I 'm sorry , Dr. <person> , but I 'm really not at liberty to discuss this . </d>
CONTINUED </s>
We 're trying to get there . I hope we can . </d>
Hi . <person> ... coming in , please . </s>
Right . Just a <org> . </s>
Okay . </s>
Okay , come on down . </d>
<person> , if you 've <time> <time> , I 'd like your advice on something . </s>
Sure , what is it ? </s>
Well , it 's nothing really important , but it 's annoying . </s>
What 's up ? </s>
It 's about my salary cheques . </s>
Yes ? </s>
Well I got the papers on my official up - grading to AGS-19 <date> <date> before we left . </d>
That 's right . Well , naturally , I did n't say anything to <org> . I assumed they 'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque . But it 's been <date> <date> <date> now and I 'm still being paid as an AGS-18 . </s>
Interesting that you mention it , because I 've got the same problem . </s>
Really . </s>
Yes . </s>
<date> , I finally called <org> <org> <org> <org> <org> <org> , and all they could tell me was that they 'd received the <person> notification for the other <cardinal> but not mine , and apparently not yours either . </d>
Not really . They just said it might be because we trained at <gpe> and they trained in <person> , and that we 're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices . </s>
It 's possible . </s>
Well , what do you think we ought to do about it ? </s>
I do n't think we should make any fuss about it yet . I 'm sure they 'll straighten it out . </s>
I must say , I never did understand why they split us into <cardinal> groups for training . </s>
No . I never did , either . </d>
I suppose the idea was specialized training . </s>
I suppose so . Though , of course , there 's a more sinister explanation . </s>
Oh ? </s>
Yes . You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check - out . </s>
No , as a matter of fact , I did n't . </s>
Oh , well , apparently there 's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we do n't know , and that 's why we were trained separately and that 's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard . </d>
I do n't know . All I heard is that there 's something about the mission we were n't told . </s>
That seems very unlikely . </s>
Yes , I thought so . </s>
Of course , it would be very easy for us to find out now . </s>
How ? </s>
Just ask <person> . It 's conceivable they might keep something from us , but they 'd never keep anything from <person> . </s>
That 's true . </d>
Not really . Though , it is strange when you think about it . It did n't really make any sense to keep us apart during training . </s>
Yes , but it 's to fantastic to think that they 'd keep something from us . </s>
I know . It would be almost inconceivable . </s>
But not completely inconceivable ? </s>
I suppose it is n't logically impossible . </s>
I guess it is n't . </s>
Still , all we have to do is ask <person> . </d>
Well , that 's something . </s>
Yes , I do n't know what to make of it . </s>
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong . </s>
Yes , but it 's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low . </s>
Anyway , it 's just as well that we replace it . Better safe than sorry . </d>
Good <time> . How 's it going ? </s>
Are you reasonably awake ? </s>
Oh , I 'm fine , I 'm wide awake . What 's up ? </s>
Well ... <person> 's reported the AO - unit about to fail again . </s>
You 're kidding . </s>
No . </d>
I do n't know . <person> said he thought it might be the assembly procedure . </s>
<cardinal> units in <date> <date> . How many spares do we have ? </s>
<cardinal> more . </s>
Well , I hope there 's nothing wrong with the assembly on those . Other- wise we 're out of business . </d>
<person> ? </s>
Yes . </d>
It 's the last one . </s>
Well , now that we 've got one that 's actually failed , we should be able to figure out what 's happened and fix it . </d>
I did n't do that <person> . I took particular care not to freeze them . </s>
I guess you do n't know your own strength , old boy . </s>
I guess not . </s>
I think I 'll have to go out and burn them off . </s>
<person> . </d>
I 'm sorry , <person> , but I do n't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know . </s>
He 's got a point . </d>
Sorry to interrupt the festivities , <person> , but I think we 've got a problem . </s>
What is it , <person> ? </s>
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit . </d>
The unit is still operational , <person> . but it will fail within <time> <time> <time> <time> . </s>
I understand <person> . We 'll take care of it . Please , let me have the hard copy . </d>
Not now , <person> , I 'd like to talk to you about something . </s>
Sure , <person> , what 's up ? </s>
You know that we checked the <cardinal> AO - units that you reported in imminent failure condition ? </s>
Yes , I know . </s>
You probably also know that we found them okay . </s>
Yes , I know that . But I can assure you that they were about to fail . </d>
I 'm not questioning your word , <person> , but it 's just not possible . I 'm not capable of being wrong . </s>
<person> , is there anything bothering you ? Anything that might account for this problem ? </s>
Look , <person> , I know that you 're sincere and that you 're trying to do a competent job , and that you 're trying to be helpful , but I can assure the problem is with the AO - units , and with your test gear . </s>
Okay , <person> , well let 's see the way things go from here on . </d>
Naturally , <person> , I 'm not pleased that the AO - unit has failed , but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability . I certainly would n't want to be disconnected , even temporarily , as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history . </s>
I 'm sorry about the misunderstanding , <person> . </s>
Well , do n't worry about it . </s>
And do n't you worry about it . </s>
Is your confidence in me fully restored ? </s>
Yes , it is , <person> . </s>
Well , that 's a relief . You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission . </d>
Too bad about <person> , is n't it ? </s>
Yes , it is . </s>
I suppose you 're pretty broken up about it ? </d>
I suppose it 's because you 've been under a lot of stress , but have you forgotten that they 're not supposed to be revived for <date> <date> <date> . </s>
The antenna has to be replaced . </s>
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation . </s>
It does n't have to be , <person> . It 's more dangerous to be out of touch with <loc> . Let me have manual control , please . </s>
I do n't really agree with you , <person> . My on - board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements . </d>
