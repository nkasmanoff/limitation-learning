"""
OpenAI Gym inspired environment for this NLP task. 

Upon resetting environment, returns the state and expert action in raw and embedding form. 

In our case conversations are only pairs, although this is a scalable approach, and as a
starting point for that we include a .step(action) function which simply returns done=True. This also allows us
to make our framework as similar as possible to previously successful approaches using GAIL.
