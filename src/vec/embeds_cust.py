"""
intersect_word2vec_format() will let you bring vectors from an external file 
into a model that's already had its own vocabulary initialized (as if by build_vocab()). 
That is, it will only load those vectors for which there are already words in the local vocabulary.
This is a way to auto-prune our vector space from the incredible large Google News Vectors 
when the majority are not related to our dataset.

It will by default lock those loaded vectors against any further adjustment during subsequent training, 
but other words in the pre-existing vocabulary may continue to update. However, we DONT want those vectors locked, so
# we change this behavior by supplying a lockf=1.0 value instead of the default 0.0. Now oov tokens (ex. <person>)
and tokens in Google News Vocab will continue to have their vectors adjusted.

*** This is best considered an experimental function and what, if any, benefits it might offer will depend 
on lots of things specific to your setup.***
